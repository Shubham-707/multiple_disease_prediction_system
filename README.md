1. Developed a diabetes disease prediction model utilizing SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to handle an imbalanced dataset. The model employed k-fold cross-validation to ensure robust evaluation. A Random Forest classifier was used, achieving an accuracy of 81%. The classification report and confusion matrix were generated to assess the model's performance.
2. Developed a heart disease prediction model using standard scaling to preprocess the data and improve model convergence. The model was constructed using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) architecture. The achieved accuracy was 80%, indicating its effectiveness in predicting heart disease cases.
3. Developed a cataract disease prediction model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and implemented data augmentation techniques to increase the diversity of the training dataset. This approach resulted in an impressive accuracy of 92% for cataract disease prediction, demonstrating the potential of CNNs for medical image analysis tasks.
4. Hosted locally all the developed disease prediction models using the Python Streamlit library. This allowed for easy deployment and access to the models through a web-based interface, making them readily available to end-users.
